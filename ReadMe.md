## Terracreds

A credential helper for Terraform Cloud/Enterprise that allows secure storage of your API token within the operating system's vault instead of in a plain text configuration file. Storing secrets in plain text can pose major security threats, and Terraform doesn't come pre-packaged with a credential helper, so we decided to create one and to share it with the greater Terraform/DevOps community to help enable stronger security practices.
